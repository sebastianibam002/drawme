Description:
A dynamic website where users can see each other's mouse movements in real-time. The system utilizes Kafka for efficient real-time data collection and analysis. Leveraging a Bayesian approach, the project aims to analyze the collected mouse movement data to predict the numbers being drawn by users on designated areas of the page, all in real-time.
